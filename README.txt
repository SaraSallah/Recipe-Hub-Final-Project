## Project Checklist

  [x] It contains at least one class written by you that has both properties and methods. It uses `__init__()` to let the class initialize the object's attributes (note that  `__init__()` doesn't count as a method). This includes instantiating the class and using the methods in your app. Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of at least one example of a class definition in your code as well as the names of two properties and two methods.
  - File name for the class definition: User
   Line number(s) for the class definition: line 3 in user.
    Name of two properties: filename, email
  - Name of two methods: add_user, delete_user
    - File name and line numbers where the methods are used: main.py , line 20,45
- [x] It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the localStorage of the web browser.
- [x] It makes use of the reading and writing to the same file feature.
- [x] It contains conditional statements. Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of at least
  one example of a conditional statement in your code.

  This value is received and processed by your back end Python code.

- [x] The code follows the code and style conventions as introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments and doesn't contain unused or experimental code. 
  In particular, the code should not use `print()` or `console.log()` for any information the app user should see. Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the browser.
